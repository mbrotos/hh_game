The project_b_29 folder contains the following content: Agile Product Backlog, Test Report, Results Report, Hogwarts Hobo Game source code. 

The Agile Product Backlog contains all the project ’s user stories and is prioritized from a scale of 1-3, where 3 holds the highest priority. Each story contains a description, 
engineering tasks, effort estimate and details. Along with the product backlog, the file also contains several charts such as: Velocity Chart, individual sprint burnout charts and 
overall project burnout chart that visualize the project project throughout the timeline.

The Test Report talks about the different tests that were run on the game and the results of those tests.

The Result Report compares the performance of a simple gameplay algorithm with that of an optimized gameplay algorithm. It also delves into the choice of algorithm and 
the different experiment that were performed.

The source code contains the code for the game play, code for testing the game, source code for the optimization algorithm and a set of pydoc html files that briefly explain the 
functionality of each function in each python file. ** Please check the pydoc folder for further technical documentation **

Requirements:

- You must have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- You must have the scipy library installed before running the game. (Note: run `python -m pip install --user scipy` to install the library) 


Instructions To Play Hogwarts Hobo:
1) Run Main.py from IDE or if running through terminal, go to file location and type: python Main.py
2) Enter the number of track you want in the game (integer only)
3) Enter the max amount of time you want the player to stay on one track (integer only)
4) Read Hobo Messages
5) You will be prompted to change tracks when either you hit a train or you time on the current track runs out.
6) Select a new track within the given range. You can decide whether you trust the hobo or not....
7) Repeat 4,5,6 until time runs out and you win or your health reaches zero.
